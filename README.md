# BowlingGame
Play a nice game of bowling, why don't you?


Creating a program to take input from user, and then calculating a bowling score based on that input.

First created three different classes: BowlingGame, BowlingCalc and Player.
The idea is for BowlingGame to be the main class, where the program will start. 
It will creaete an instane of the Player class, which will have the setters and getters for the input.
Then it will go into BowlingCalc to make the neccessary calculations and produce a score

Finnaly, the BowlingGame class will show the score.

-----------------------------------------------

Final edit, after finishing the program:

Java program that takes input from the user and calculates a abowling score from it.

Press enter after every roll of the ball, typing the number of pins knocked.

consists of three classes, BowlingGame class being the main one where the program starts.
