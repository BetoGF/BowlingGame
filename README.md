# BowlingGame
Play a nice game of bowling, why don't you?


Creating a program to take input from user, and then calculating a bowling score based on that input.

First created three different classes: BowlingGame, BowlingCalc and Player.
The idea is for BowlingGame to be the main class, where the program will start. 
It will creaete an instane of the Player class, which will have the setters and getters for the input.
Then it will go into BowlingCalc to make the neccessary calculations and produce a score

Finnaly, the BowlingGame class will show the score.
